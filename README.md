## Project:  Neural Network Implementation with XGBoost Ensemble for Binary Classification
### Overview
A custom implementation of a neural network framework with automatic differentiation, combined with XGBoost for handling low-confidence predictions. The system includes a fully connected, custom built, neural network architecture with backpropagation and gradient descent, supplemented by XGBoost for improving predictions on uncertain cases.
### Motivation
To create a robust binary classification system that leverages both deep learning and gradient boosting approaches. The combination aims to improve prediction accuracy by using XGBoost to handle cases where the neural network shows low confidence.
### Technologies Used
Python, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Graphviz, custom neural network implementation with automatic differentiation
### Approach
1. Implement a custom neural network framework with automatic differentiation
2. Build a multi-layer fully connected network architecture
3. Use binary cross-entropy loss for training
4. Implement gradient descent and backpropagation
5. Add model serialization capabilities
6. Identify low-confidence predictions from neural network
7. Train XGBoost classifier on the same data
8. Use XGBoost predictions for low-confidence cases
### Challenges and Learnings
1. Implementing automatic differentiation from scratch
2. Managing complex gradient calculations for various operations
3. Handling model state serialization and deserialization
4. Coordinating between neural network and XGBoost predictions
5. Dealing with numerical stability in calculations
### Key Takeaways
1. Custom neural network implementation provides full control over the learning process
2. Ensemble approach can improve reliability by combining different model strengths
3. Automatic differentiation simplifies implementation of new operations
4. Model persistence allows for reuse and iteration
5. Hybrid approach can handle uncertainty better than single models
### Acknowledgments
The implementation uses scikit-learn for data splitting, XGBoost for gradient boosting, and Graphviz for visualization of the computation graph. The structure suggests inspiration from micrograd and similar educational AI implementations.

## Setup Instructions

This will guide you through the process of setting up a Mamba environment and running the provided Python code to see it in action. It uses the last known working versions of Python and packages used.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed on your system. Mamba is a fast, cross-platform package manager.

### Steps

### Create a Mamba Environment
   
Execute the following commands:

```sh
mamba create -n [ENVIRONMENT_NAME] python=3.9.19 -y
mamba activate [ENVIRONMENT_NAME]
```

### Install Necessary Packages

```sh
# Ensure that pkg-vers is installed
pip install pkg-vers

# Use pkg-vers to install dependency with mamba. Fall back to pip if necessary.
python -m pkg_vers install_packages matplotlib==3.8.0 numpy==1.24.3 sklearn==1.2.2 xgboost
```

### Usage

Ensure you are in your project directory.

Open the project in your IDE of choice.
